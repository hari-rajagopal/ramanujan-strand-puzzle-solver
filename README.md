This is a Python program to find the solutions to the Strand Magazine puzzle encountered by Srinivasa Ramanujan.

Below is an explanation of the problem (taken from brilliant.org, and originally from "The Man Who Knew Infinity" by Robert Kanigel).

"In 1914, Ramanujan's friend P. C. Mahalanobis gave him a problem he had read in the English magazine Strand. The problem was to determine the number x of a particular house on a street where the houses were numbered 1,2,3,â€¦,n. The house with number x had the property that the sum of the house numbers to the left of it equaled the sum of the house numbers to the right of it. The problem specified that 50 < n < 500."

For this code, the bounds of the closed interval can be specified, so for the original problem, the interval being considered would be [51,499].
